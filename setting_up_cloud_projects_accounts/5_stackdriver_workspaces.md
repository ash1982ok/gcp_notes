# What is a Workspace?

A Workspace is a tool for monitoring resources contained in one or more Google Cloud projects or AWS accounts. 
A Workspace accesses metric data from its monitored projects, but the metric data remains in those projects.

A Google Cloud project or AWS account can be monitored by exactly 1 Workspace. 
A Workspace always monitors its Google Cloud host project. 
However, you can configure a Workspace to monitor up to *** 100 Google Cloud *** projects and AWS accounts.
