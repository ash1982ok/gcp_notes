The project resource is the base-level organizing entity. Organizations and folders may contain multiple projects.

All projects consist of the following:

Two identifiers:
Project ID, which is a unique identifier for the project.
Project number, which is automatically assigned when you create the project. It is read-only.
One mutable display name.
The lifecycle state of the project; for example, ACTIVE or DELETE_REQUESTED.
A collection of labels that can be used for filtering projects.
The time when the project was created.

The following code snippet shows the structure of a project:

{
  "name": "myproject",
  "projectId": "my-project-123",
  "labels":
   {
     "my-label": "prod"
   },
   "projectNumber": "464036093014",
   "lifecycleState": "ACTIVE",
   "createTime": "2016-01-07T21:59:43.314Z"
}
