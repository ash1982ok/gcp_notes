# Key features

***gcloud command-line tool***
The gcloud CLI manages authentication, local configuration, developer workflow, interactions with Google Cloud APIs. 
With the gcloud command-line tool, it’s easy to perform many common cloud tasks, like creating a Compute Engine VM instance,
managing a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster, and deploying an App Engine application, either from the command line 
or in scripts and other automations.

***Client Libraries***
Cloud SDK comes with installable language-specific Cloud Client Libraries and Google API Client Libraries. 
These libraries use each supported language’s natural conventions and styles, handling authentication, 
reducing the amount of necessary boilerplate code, and optimizing the developer workflow.

***Product-specific command-line tools***
A collection of command-line tools comes packaged with Cloud SDK, including ***gsutil, bq, and kubectl.*** 
The gsutil tool allows you to manage Cloud Storage buckets and objects using the command line. 
Run queries and manipulate datasets, tables, and entities in BigQuery through the command line with bq. 
With kubectl, you can deploy and manage Kubernetes container clusters using the command line.
