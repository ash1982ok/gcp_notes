# Compute engine options from google

***Compute Engine - IaaS***
— allows you to create your own virtual machine by allocating hardware specific resources 
e.g. RAM, CPU, Storage. It is also very hands on and low level.

***Kubernetes Engine - Caas/Kaas***
— Is a step up from Compute Engine, and allows you to use Kubernetes and 
Containers to manage your application, allowing it to scale when need be.

***App Engine - PaaS***
— Is a step up from Kubernetes Engine and allows you to focus only on your code, 
whilst Google handles all the underlying platform requirements.

***Cloud-Functions - FaaS***
— Is the final step in the compute pyramid, and allows one to write a simple function that when triggered, 
uses all the underlying infrastructure to compute and return a result.
