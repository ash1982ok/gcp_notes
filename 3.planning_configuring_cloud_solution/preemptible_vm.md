# Low cost VMs

Preemptible VMs are highly affordable, short-lived compute instances suitable for batch jobs and fault-tolerant workloads. 
Preemptible VMs offer the same machine types and options as regular compute instances and last for up to 24 hours.

If your applications are fault tolerant and can withstand possible instance preemptions, 
then preemptible instances can reduce your Compute Engine costs by up to 80%!
